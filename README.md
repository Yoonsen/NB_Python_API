# NB_Python_API
Code for accessing and analyzing data from the API connected to texts at the National Library of Norway. It consists of two Python files, one for accessing feature sets of texts, and one for fetching ngrams.

There are a couple of notebooks as well, for doing ngram analysis, for creating collocation clusters, corpus analysis and character (or in general any set of words) networks and growth diagrams.
